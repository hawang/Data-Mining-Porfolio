My partner is Zack Tillotson. This is the wine quality data set from
the machine learning repository at University of California ar Irving:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

attribute information is:
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

they say this can be used for regression in classification. their research is
anomoly detection.

We have two data sets, redwine and whitewine.

i addition to predicting quality I would propose to Zack that we can predict by looking
at the attributes to predict the type of wine. red or white knowing the sugar, acidity, cholorides, etc.
